st.write('Data labeling or annotation invovles marking raw data with the correct answers to facilitate supervised machine learning. During training, your model will learn to identify patterns in new data and make accurate predictions based on these labels. Therefore, the quality and accuracy of the labels are crucial for the success of machine learning models.')

st.subheader('Feature Extraction - Time-frequency domain features')
st.write('This domain integrates both time and frequency elements, utilizing different types of spectograms to visually represent sound. A spectogram can be derived from a waveform by applying the short-time Fourier transform. Among the most widely used features in the time-frequency domain are mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). These features operate within the range of human hearing and are thus based on the mel scale and mel spectogram previously mentioned.')
